## Welcome to my Coding Life

Hi, my name is Erik Nielsen, and I am an aspiring quantitative trader at the University of Michigan studying business administration and computer science. When I'm not watching the markets, coding complex projects, or studying math, you can typically find me in the outdoors or playing basketball.
